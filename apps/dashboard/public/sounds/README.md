# Audio Assets

Place `notification.mp3` in this directory for audio alerts.

Requirements:
- Short notification sound (1-2 seconds)
- MP3 format for browser compatibility
- Reasonable file size (<100KB recommended)

The audio file is used by `useAudioAlerts` hook when new orchestrator items need attention.
