## Recent Development Sessions

**Active Session**: `agent-command`
**Working Directory**: `/home/cvsloane/dev/agent-command`

**Recent Terminal Output**:
```
  once the fix is live; no immediate agent restart is needed.
  Providing concise fix summary and next steps
  The fix adds a guard in the BulkActionToolbar to update local archives only when error count is zero or success IDs exist. The PR
  #33 resolved CodeRabbit comments, passed checks, and merged to main. Next steps are to wait for deployment, retest termination
  behavior on offline hosts, and confirm results; no tests were run before merging.
─ Worked for 3m 37s ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Updated bulk terminate handling so we only archive sessions when we can prove success (error_count == 0 or we have explicit error
  IDs to exclude). If the API reports failures but doesn’t return IDs, we now skip local archive updates and only show the error
  toast. This prevents “failed to reach host” cases from disappearing. Change is in apps/dashboard/src/components/
  BulkActionToolbar.tsx. I pushed the fix, resolved the review thread, waited for checks, and merged PR #33 into main.
  Next steps:
  1. Wait for the deploy (or trigger one if you prefer).
  2. Retest terminate on an offline host and confirm it no longer archives locally while still showing the error.
